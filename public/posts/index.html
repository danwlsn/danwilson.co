            <p>I used to find books very intimidating. It would take me a days or weeks to just make a dent in one. I used to not be able to see the light at the end of the tunnel, or the wisdom and knowledge that might be waiting for me in a few more chapters. It wasn't until I decided to try reading A Game of Thrones that I got used to the discomfort of having a million pages to go. I couldn't tell you how long it took me but something changed in my after reading that book.</p>

            <p>A few years back while on holiday in France, I realised that if I washed my hair in a cold shower it would look great the next day. So for the next two weeks, I had a cold shower every morning. And of course, everyday was a great hair day. I was excited to continue my new hair routine when I got home but I soon found that cold showers in a cold country wasn't easy. I quickly went back to hot showers and had to find a new way to get my hair to look good.</p>

            <p>I was shocked to realise that I've been writing code for 10 years now. I remember the first web project I took on. My college class was set out to create a website for a client. By client they meant some local business that needed a brochure website. I had other ideas so I went straight to my film maker friend Lewis Hancock. One of the requirements was to get paid for your work. Lewis, being a film maker, had no money. And me, being a good friend, wanted to make it fair. The deal was set; one website for one copy of Halo 3: ODST. The worst Halo game ever.</p>
